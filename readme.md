# React Native Sample Project

## Installation

Before you do anything, make sure you have node package manager installed, as well as have an Android or iOS device nearby for testing. If you don't have either, then install the Android Studio for Windows or Xcode for Mac. [Here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) is more information on installing NPM.

With npm installed, clone the repository and follow the next few lines for how to install required elements
```
git clone git@github.com:harvzheng/csc630-spring-presentation2.git
cd csc630-spring-presentation2
npm install react-native
npm install expo-cli
npm install
```
Once that's done, you can run
```
npm start
```
to get the necessary packages installed and to start the server up. From here, a new tab will open on something like `localhost:19002`

There, you'll see a QR code in the bottom left corner, along with three connection options: Tunnel, LAN, and Local. It's recommended to pick tunnel since your device and laptop won't necessarily be on the same IP on school wifi. ***With the Expo app installed on your phone***, scan the QR code and the app will be displayed on your device.
